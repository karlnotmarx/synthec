# Human Annotation Protocol

Two independent human annotators working in the financial industry
labeled 20 synthetic earnings call excerpts.

## Each annotator assigned one sentiment label per paragraph:
- positive
- neutral
- negative


## Purpose
1. Measure inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s κ)
2. Compare human consensus vs FinBERT predictions
3. Evaluate the evaluator (model-as-judge reliability)

Annotations were performed independently without discussion.
